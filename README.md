# Hello Viewer

This is a CPP program which prints the path of a knight from a source to a destination on a 8 X 8 Chessboard.
The position mapping can be seen in `mappings.png`.

It uses the concept of minimal path in an undirected unweighted Graph using `Breadth First Search` algorithm.

Thank You
